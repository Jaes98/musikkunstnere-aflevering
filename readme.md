Follow these steps to run the app:

1. Open the repository in VScode

2. Use the terminal to install the different dependencies by typing: "npm i cors", "npm i express" and end with "npm start".

3. Make your way to the terminal, from which you have to type "node --watch backend/backend.js" which will run the backend javascript in the background
(the terminal should have a message for you saying "App running on http://localhost;3333").

4. Now that you have the backend up and running, make your way to the "frontend" folder in the terminal and type "code ." this will open your frontend code in a new vscode window.

5. Now either right click on index.html and choose "Open with live server" or use the "Go live" button on the bottom right of your screen.

6. Now the app should be up and running and you are free to experiment with the different CRUD elements.
